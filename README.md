## Description

This project proposes a low-cost, scalable, human-inspired memory framework for AI.  
By mimicking how humans compress and reflect on experiences, we introduce a 3-tier memory structure:

- **Daily logs** (raw experiences)
- **Monthly summaries** (pattern recognition)
- **Yearly reflections** (evolving identity)

This allows AI agents to develop long-term memory, simulate growth, and form a consistent personality over time.
